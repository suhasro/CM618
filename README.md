### **Project Outline**

This project analyzes European summer (June–July) temperatures to understand how human activities have influenced recent heatwaves.
We compare three datasets — ERA5 observations, CESM2 natural-only simulations, and CESM2 all-forcings simulations — to estimate the change in heatwave probability.
The analysis includes:

* Extracting and averaging summer temperatures over Europe (35°–60°N, -10°–40°E).
* Defining a 95th-percentile threshold from natural (NAT) simulations to represent extreme heat.
* Calculating the Probability Ratio (PR) to measure how much more likely heatwaves are under human influence.
* Visualizing results through time series, histograms, and temperature anomaly maps.

The results show that extreme European heat events are now about **5.5 times more likely** due to anthropogenic climate change.
